Chengine is a game engine I wrote while researching game development. It was later used to make a short concept of a game. Areas of focus included systems design, several different graphics renderers, experimenting with different shaders to explore lighting and shadows, implementing a physics system using Bullet Physics, and exploring different ways of implementing an entity component system. It was designed to be data-driven and highly flexible.
