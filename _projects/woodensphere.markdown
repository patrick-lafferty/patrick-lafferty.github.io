Wooden Sphere (code name, not working title) is a first person stealth game I'm currently working on. In this game you are a library shelver who needs to accomplish various tasks in a library, without being seen by the patrons or staff. In the single player campaign mode you are given a mission of five random tasks to perform throughout the day. The tasks include shelving, sorting, weeding, and collecting certain books spread out across the maze-like library. After completing a task the time of day advances by two hours, which affects both the number of people and the lighting in the library. Before the mission starts you are given a map and list of tasks which you reorder in a schedule, the idea being tasks which might be more complicated are more suited to earlier or later times in the day. The game is powered by Unreal Engine 4.
